## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in HadesFit, please report it to us by following these steps:

1. **Do not** open an issue on GitHub for security vulnerabilities. This ensures that the vulnerability does not become public before it can be addressed.

2. **Email us** at [cubedimension@protonmail.com](mailto:cubedimension@protonmail.com) with the subject line "HadesFit Security Report".

3. **Provide us with the following information**:
   - Type of vulnerability (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection, etc.)
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Proof of Concept (PoC) if possible
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any other relevant details or screenshots

4. **Use encryption** if possible. Our PGP key can be found [here](#pgp-key) to encrypt your email.

## Disclosure Policy

- **Private Disclosure**: Initially, we aim for private handling of the vulnerability. We will keep you updated on our progress towards a fix.

- **Public Disclosure**: Once we have a fix, we will release it in a new version of HadesFit. We will then coordinate with you on public disclosure:
  - We request you give us at least 7 days from the release of the patch to allow users to update their software before any public announcement.
  - We will credit you for your discovery unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

- **No Legal Action**: We will not take legal action against you if you act in good faith according to these guidelines.
